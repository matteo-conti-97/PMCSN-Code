DES-Python
==========

C code from Discrete Event Simulation: A First Course translated into Python 3.3

Run any of the programs with 'python3 filename.py'

To run a program with a datafile, you can run either 'cat data.dat | python3 file.py' or 'python3 file.py < data.dat'. The latter will not work in Powershell/Cmd if you use Windows.
